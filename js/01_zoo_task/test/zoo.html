This file is simply here to allow your browser's JavaScript console to access the test.js file.
<p>
<b>Google Chrome</b> recommended for this assignment. Open the console by selecting View in the main menu, then Developer, then JavaScript Console.
</p>
Once you've opened the console, type "<code>helloworld()</code>" in the console (without the quotes) to run the helloworld() function in test.js.
<p>
Your browser should print "hello world!" in the console. If so, you're ready to proceed!
